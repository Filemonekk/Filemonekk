I am looking for long-term cooperation where, as a beginner front-end developer, I will strongly develop my skills and will be committed to creating and developing the projects set before me. My previous professional experience has taught me excellent teamwork, punctuality and responsibility. Graduated studies are a guarantee of analytical and technical thinking. Using the above, I eagerly create projects in JavaScript. I am intensively expanding my knowledge of React and TypeScript technologies.

In my free time, I like to spend time actively and socially. I travel regularly, and when I have a burst ofenergy, I try my hand at wakeboarding.
